We launch spacecraft into space by putting them on rockets. The propellants give the rocket enough energy to boost away from Earth’s surface. Once a rocket launches Earth's gravity is still pulling down on the rocket. [clear]To launch, the rocket needs enough propellants so that the thrust pushing the rocket up is greater than the force of gravity pulling the rocket down. A rocket needs to speed up to at least 17,800 miles per hour and fly above most of the atmosphere, in a curved path around Earth.[clear] The balance between gravity and momentum keeps the satellite orbiting around Earth. This ensures that it won’t be pulled back down to the ground.
